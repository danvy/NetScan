# NetScan
The Raspberry PI IP address scanner

##Introduction
In the night of January 24th of 2015, I was attending the Microsoft #Zone61 IoT hackathon in Paris, exited to spend sometime hacking my Raspberry PI. I plugged it, launched Putty and... I was unable to type the IP address of my little headless machine, lost among dozens of machine on the network. I needed a simple way to spot it so I wrote this little utility in C# than scan all the machines on the same network, and list those that looks like a Raspberry PI.
